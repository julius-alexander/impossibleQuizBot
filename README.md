Simple program that plays The Impossible Quiz

NOTE: This program ONLY works with a display of size 1920x1080

To set up environment to run program, follow this link "https://shorturl.at/hmxEP" (without the quotes)

Or, if you don't trust the link, search "The Impossible Quiz" on the website Poki.com

Once loaded, maximize your window and zoom to 200%, making sure you are at the top of the page

You will have to press "Begin" and "Start" manually.

You may run the program once you have followed all instructions thus far and are on the first question

Enjoy!


TODO:
- There are several timing optimizations that can be made throughout (e.g., Q68 & Q81)
- Portability would be nice to have; the set-up is rather specific and restrictive (work on functionality for other resolutions)
- Code was hastily written in a few hours, clean-up is required if it is to be made more robust
